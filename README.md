# Datadog Instrumentation API

``datadog-instrumentation`` is Datadog's instrumentation API for Ruby. It can be used to install hooks into Ruby application code, and expose or alter operations for monitoring purposes. This gem is intended as a base for other APM packages, and does not provide any instrumentation out-of-the-box.

For out-of-the-box instrumentation, see these other repositories:
 - [``ddtrace``: Datadog tracing & profiling](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb)

## Quickstart
